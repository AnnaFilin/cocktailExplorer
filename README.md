- ⚙️ **MVVM Architecture:** Simple & clean state management.
- 🎨 **Subtle Animations:** Smooth fade/scale transitions for better UX.

## 🚩 Known limitations

This version is **optimized for common iPhone screen sizes**.  
Small screens (e.g. iPhone SE) and iPad layouts may break the current layout — fixing this would require a dedicated responsive pass.

Also, there are a few open polish tasks:
- Ingredient chips sometimes shift width when selected.
- Small visual tweaks on button paddings and shadow effects could be refined.
- Some layout values and fonts can be unified better for consistency.

## 🗂️ TODO / Next Steps

- [ ] Polish responsive design for small screens & iPad.
- [ ] Revisit ingredient chip layout for more stable sizing.
- [ ] Add more subtle animations (e.g. smoother appear/disappear of filtered blocks).
- [ ] Add unit/UI tests for basic flows.
- [ ] Optional: Polish `README` with GIF preview or screen recording.

## 🚀 Status

**Prototype complete & published.**  
This project will stay open for possible micro-improvements, but major extensions (like full iPad split views) are out of scope for this version.
